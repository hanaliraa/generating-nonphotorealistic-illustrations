# Generating Non-Photorealistic Illustrations from Images
There has been work done in Non-Photorealistic Rendering
(NPR) using image processing techniques (such as mosaicking,
glass painting, caricatures and more) but given the variance
in types of images, the methods used for each application
vary. This paper discusses a novel application of existing image
processing techniques: generating illustrated versions of
objects from images to be used as graphic elements in digital
design. Since MATLAB has a rich variety of algorithms
available in its Image Processing Toolbox in the form of functions,
the scope of this project is to utilize these algorithms
to achieve an illustrated effect in methods that are similar to
those used for other NPR purposes that were explored in the
literature review. This would give us an insight into the effectiveness
of existing algorithms for this application and set the
stage for further work.
